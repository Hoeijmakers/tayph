Demonstration tutorial
**********************


Along with the core package of Tayph , a package with demo data is made available containing a part of the HARPS data
that was first used to find iron in the transmission spectrum of the UHJ KELT-9 b. This package also contains the necessary
configuration files and templates to obtain cross-correlations reminiscent of Hoeijmakers et al. (2018), but without the
application of telluric correction.

To get started, download Tayph, open a terminal in the root folder and run::

    python3 setup.py install.

This installs Tayph as a python package on your system.

Create an empty directory somewhere on your system. This will be the working directory that contains your dataset(s), models,
templates, and Tayph output. For the purpose of this walk-through, we will assume that folder is located at
/Users/tayph/xcor_project/

Open a python interpreter and call::

    import tayph.run
    tayph.run.make_project_folder(p)

where you have set p to a string describing the filepath of the empty directory you just created. This creates the necessary folder structure Tayph uses.

Download the dummy data, located here [URL]. You may also download any other pipeline-reduced HARPS dataset from the ESO archive.
A pipeline-reduced dataset will consist of a number of files for each exposure, i.e. e2ds_A/B, s1d_A/B, blaze_A/B files, etc.
Tayph does *not* work on raw echelle data. For the purpose of this walk-through, we will assume that this folder is located at
/Users/tayph/downloads/HARPS_data/. Take care to download and process only *one* transit at a time. Do not put the observations
of multiple transits in the same download folder, because Tayph will treat them as a single time-series. Although certain
use-cases may exist where this is desirable, it is non-standard from the point of view of present literature.

Open a python interpreter in your working directory (i.e. /Users/tayph/xcor_project/) and call::

    import tayph.read
    tayph.read.read_e2ds('/Users/tayph/downloads/HARPS_data/','KELT-9/night1','',nowave=True,molecfit=False,mode='HARPS',ignore_exp=[])

to convert the pipeline-reduced data to the format used by Tayph, and place it in the data folder in your working directory.
The input parameters mean the following:
The first parameter is the location of your downloaded data.
The second is the name of your dataset, as a folder name. Typically, this takes the form of system_name_b, or system_name_b/night_n
if multiple transits of the same system are available.
The third is the location of your configuration file (see below). This is only needed in case Molecfit is used (because the
configuration file points Tayph to where Molecfit is installed). This is left blank for now because we are not planning to
use Molecfit at the moment.
The nowave keyword indicates whether a wavelength file is present in the downloaded data. This would be the case if you had
run the HARPS pipeline yourself, but the wavelength file is typically not present for data downloaded from the archive.
We therefore set this keyword to True, telling Tayph to take the wavelength solution from the FITS headers instead.
Molecfit is set to False because we ignore it for the time being. For most metals in the optical, telluric correction is not
crucially important, at least in first instance.
The mode keyword can be used to switch between HARPS, ESPRESSO, UVES-red and UVES-blue modes. In this case, we are dealing
with HARPS data.
ignore_exp can be set to a list of integers, which allows you to ignore exposures in the time series. This can be useful if you
find out, after reading in the data that some exposures are bad for whatever reason; and you want to ignore these from the
analysis without going around deleting files. Of course you'd want to do this inspection before running Molecfit (if you were
going to), because Molecfit will need to be run again after ignore_exp is changed, and typically takes a long time.

This has produced a new folder /Users/tayph/xcor_project/data/KELT-9/night1/, in which the various files are located. This has
not created a configuration file, which we will typically need to make ourselves, but one is provided in the prepackaged template.
The configuration file is a 2-column tab-separated table with keywords in the first column and corresponding values in the second
column. The configuration file for this dataset may look like this::

    P			1.4811235
    a			0.03462
    aRstar			3.153
    Rp			1.891
    Mp			2.48
    K       0.275
    RpRstar			0.08228
    vsys    -18
    RA			20:31:26.4
    DEC			+39:56:20
    Tc			2457095.68572
    duration		235.0
    resolution		110000.0
    inclination		86.79
    vsini       111.0
    air         True

which describe the orbital period in days, the semi-major axis in AU, the mass/radius of the planet relative to Jupiter, the radial
velocity semi-amplitude of the star in km/s, the radius-ratio of the planet and star, the systemic velocity in km/s, the RA and DEC
coordinates, the transit center time, the spectral resolution of the instrument, the transit duration in minutes, the orbital
inclination in degrees (close to 90 if the planet is transiting), the projected equatorial rotation velocity of the stellar disk,
whether or not the wavelength solution is in air.

After the data is reformatted and a configuration file is created, we need to point Tayph to a set of models that are going to be used as
cross-correlation templates and (optionally) for model injection-comparison. Models are located in the /Users/tayph/xcor_project/models/ directory,
with optional subdirectories for different sets of models. In most use-cases, the user will have multiple sets of models to choose from, which
may or may not be similar in their naming or content. To be able to access different sets of models, Tayph assumes that models are organised
in so-called libraries, which are ASCII tables that act as dictionaries with which the user can refer to model files saved in subfolders using short-hand names or labels.
The library file and template name/label are passed to Tayph at runtime, and the library files are structured as 2-column ASCII tables in the models/
directory. A typical library file called KELT-9-models.dat may look as follows::

  FeI     KELT-9/4000K_Fe.fits
  FeII    KELT-9/4000K_Fe_p.fits
  TiI     KELT-9/4000K_Ti.fits
  TiII    KELT-9/4000K_Ti_p.fits
  TiO     KELT-9/3000K_TiO.fits
  H2O     KELT-9/3000K_H2O.fits

Individual models are assumed to be saved in FITS files, in subdirectories starting in the /Users/tayph/xcor_project/models/ directory. E
In this example, the FITS files are located at in the /Users/tayph/xcor_project/models/KELT-9 directory. ach FITS file is a 2-row FITS image, with
wavelength (in nm) on the first row, and flux on the second row. In the case of transit spectra, this flux will typically be the expected transit radius of the planet as a function
of wavelength. To convert models into cross-correlation templates, Tayph (optionally) performs a continuum subtraction (controlled by the c_subtract switch below).
Examples of a model/template library file and associated model files are prepackaged along with the dummy data. Place these in the models subfolder of the working directory.

A second library file located at /Users/tayph/xcor_project/models/WASP-123-models.dat relevant to a different exoplanet system may take the following form::

  FeI_2k      WASP-123/2000K_FeI.fits
  FeI_3k      WASP-123/3000K_FeI.fits
  FeII_3k     WASP-123/3000K_FeII.fits
  FeI_2k      WASP-123/2000K_TiI.fits
  FeI_3k      WASP-123/3000K_TiI.fits
  FeII_3k     WASP-123/3000K_TiII.fits
  TiO         WASP-123/2000K_TiO.fits
  H2O         WASP-123/2000K_H2O.fits

For each run of Tayph, only one model library or template library may be specified, so the user should organise their library files according to what models and templates they wish to run in batches.






Finally, we proceed by creating a run-file that specifies the working settings of our cross-correlation run. This file is again a 2-column ASCII table with keywords in the first column
and values in the second. This may look like below. The entries in the second column may be followed by commentary that
explains keywords or choices that are not self-descriptive or that you wish to remember.::

This file is typically saved in the working directory (i.e. /Users/tayph/xcor_project/testrun.dat), and is the primer for initialising
a cross-correlation run by calling::

    import tayph.run
    run.start_run('testrun.dat')
